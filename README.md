# 🧠 Advanced SQL Challenges

This project presents a curated collection of advanced SQL queries and exercises aimed at solving real-world business questions. It showcases Felipe's ability to design performant joins, leverage analytic functions, and build logic-rich queries using a star schema model.

---

## 🎯 Business Context

Companies rely on advanced SQL to uncover operational inefficiencies, customer trends, and financial anomalies. These queries replicate scenarios faced by analytics engineers, data analysts, and BI developers working with star schemas and large datasets.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **SQL**: Window functions, CTEs, aggregation, filtering
- **Star Schema Modeling**: Dimension and fact tables
- **PostgreSQL / SQLite / T-SQL**: Compatible syntax
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and code review

## 📊 Example Scenarios

> These queries are written and tested against mock retail data.

- **Top 3 Products by Revenue**  
- **Sales by Region**  
- **Weekend vs Weekday Revenue Analysis**  
- **Monthly Sales Trend**  
- **Profit Margin by Store** *(requires cost data)*  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** *(extendable)*

## 🏃 How to Run Locally

You can run these queries in any SQL engine, or directly from a lightweight engine like **SQLite** or **DuckDB**.

### Option 1: DuckDB (recommended)
1. Install DuckDB: https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/
2. Launch interactive mode:  
   ```bash
   duckdb
